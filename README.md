# Pacmen
This web page allows users to create Pacmen.

Please download the project to run it locally.
The **index.html** file is the entry point to the webpage.

When the **Add Pacmen** button is clicked, a Pacman figure is generated at a random position on the page.
To get the pacmen to start moving, the user should click the **Start Game** button.
Once they start moving, the **Start Game** button can be used to increase their speed on the screen.

One of the improvements that can be made is to make sure to include other images of the Pacmen to make the game more dynamic.
